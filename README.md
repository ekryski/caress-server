# Caress Server#

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekryski/caress-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ekryski/caress-server)

*Caress Server* is a NodeJS + Socket.io backed Javascript implementation of the [TUIO protocol](http://www.tuio.org) bringing true cross platform TUIO support. Used in conjunction with the [Caress Client](https://github.com/ekryski/caress-client/) you now get true cross browser multi-touch support and tactile interaction in the web browser.

### Background ###
[TUIO](http://tuio.org/) is based on the [OSC protocol](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) and usually transferred via UDP. Caress uses NodeJS and websockets via ([Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)) to push OSC/TUIO messages to the browser. The Caress server listens for raw TUIO events, processes them, and then exposes them, as either an array or JSON, through an event emitter. Therefore consuming is as simple as listening for `'tuio'` events.

## Getting Started
### Server
**Install the server via npm:**

    npm install caress-server

**To run an example:**

* start the example server
    * `node examples/server.js`
* open up one of the html files
* Grab a [TUIO Tracker](http://tuio.org/?software) and start playing around


The server listens for TUIO input on the default TUIO port: 3333. If you need to change this for some reason you can change it when you create a new TUIO server:

    var CaressServer = require('caress-server');
    var caress = new CaressServer('0.0.0.0', 3333, {json: true});

    caress.on('tuio', function(msg){
      console.log(msg);
    });

That's it that's all. Now you can do whatever you want with that TUIO data.

### Client
Grab the [Caress Client](https://github.com/ekryski/caress-client/) and drop it into your web page.
